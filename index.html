            <p>My Name is Rafael Galvez. I was born in the Philippines. Came to America when I was 6 years old and lived
                in
                Belleville, New Jersey ever since.
                I love New Jersey and everything it has to offer. I mean, New York City is roughly a 20 min drive! Seems
                crazy to think how fortunate we are to have
                such an amazing city thats accessible to everybody. I don't really announce this but I do enjoy taking
                pictures. No I am not a "photographer",
                I simply just enjoy being behind the lens.
                <br>
                <p>I'm not student type of person but when it comes to this program I'm taking, I am filled with
                    excitement
                    to learn about coding. Having the ability
                    to create what ever you can think of is just incredible.
