<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Rafael Galvez. I was born in the Philippines. Came to America when I was 6 years old and lived in Belleville, New Jersey ever since. 
   I love New Jersey and everything it has to offer. I mean, New York City is roughly a 20 min drive! Seems crazy to think how fortunate we are to have
   such an amazing city thats accessible to everybody. I don't really announce this but I do enjoy taking pictures. No I am not a "photographer", 
   I simply just enjoy being behind the lens. 
</p>
<p>I'm not student type of person but when it comes to this program I'm taking, I am filled with excitement to learn about coding. Having the ability
    to create what ever you can think of is just incredible.
